        <p>I am a science journalist. Most recently, I was a <a href="http://www.dvm360.com/jennifer-gaumnitz-senior-content-specialist" target="_blank">senior content specialist with dvm360.com.</a> I worked for the organization in its various incarnations for more than 34 years, for several years serving as managing editor of the journal <em>Veterinary Medicine</em>. I also worked on production of or edited three books: <em>Small Animal Clinical Nutrition,</em> 4th edition; <em>Field Guide to Colic Management in the Horse</em>; and <em>The U.S. Animal Health Industry: Its Pioneers and Their Legacy of Innovation</em>.</p>

        <p>I was born in Naperville, Illinois, grew up in Dubuque, Iowa, and have lived in the Kansas City metropolitan area for 35 years. I have a bachelorâ€™s degree in Journalism and Mass Communication with an emphasis in Science Writing and a minor in Zoology from Iowa State University. While at Iowa State, I was the editor of <em>The Iowa Engineer</em>.</p>

        <p>I enjoy horseback riding, working on our 55-acre farm with my husband, gardening, reading, and spending time with my adult children when I can. My daughter lives in Madison, Wisconsin, with her husband. She works for Epic Systems, a large healthcare software company, on a team that answers requests for proposals. My son and his wife live in Overland Park, Kansas. He is a third-year medical student at the University of Kansas School of Medicine.</p>
